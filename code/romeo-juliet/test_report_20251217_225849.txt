ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Strengths:
  ✓ None of the factual information about the play or the characters requested by the question was returned. The statement 'no information was found' is an accurate reflection of the graph's internal state (empty for this query) but not a correct answer to the question about the subject matter.
  ✓ The graph's self-assessment that the information is 'missing or incomplete' is accurate, though it doesn't provide any useful data for the question itself.
  ✓ None. The answer returned is a categorical denial of information that exists, making it entirely incorrect.

Weaknesses:
  ✗ Event: Tybalt initiates confrontation with Romeo (Act 3, Scene 1).
  ✗ Benvolio Montague (as Mercutio's companion, with detailed relationship characteristics)
  ✗ Event: Tybalt fatally stabs Mercutio.
  ✗ Verona (general setting, public streets)
  ✗ The nature of Mercutio's close friendship with Romeo (banter, wit, loyalty, teasing, concern for honor)

Discrepancies Found:
  ⚠️  The graph database answer claims 'no information regarding these specific events' was returned, whereas the authoritative answer details the entire sequence of events leading to Tybalt's death.
  ⚠️  The graph states that no locations could be identified, which directly contradicts the authoritative answer's extensive list of significant locations.
  ⚠️  The graph database states that 'the relationships between Mercutio and his friends cannot be determined,' which is a direct consequence of its initial incorrect premise and is also false as these relationships are well-documented in the play.
  ⚠️  The graph implies an absence of data, while the authoritative answer demonstrates that such data is rich and readily available from the source text.
  ⚠️  The graph database answer states 'no characters could be identified', which is factually incorrect as the authoritative answer identifies Tybalt, Mercutio, Romeo, and Benvolio.

RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Connect Tybalt's death to the resulting consequence: `(Tybalt's_Death)-[LEADS_TO]->(Romeo's_Banishment)`.
2. Add 'Benvolio' as a node with a 'cousin_of' and 'friend_of' relationship to 'Romeo Montague'.
3. Establish relationships from 'Mercutio' to 'Romeo Montague' with a predicate like `IS_BEST_FRIEND_WITH` or `HAS_CLOSE_FRIEND`, and add attributes describing the relationship (e.g., 'characterized by banter, wit, loyalty, affectionate teasing').
4. Add 'Balthasar' as a node with a 'loyal_servant_of' relationship to 'Romeo Montague'.
5. Ensure that the data includes the causality and progression of events tied to these locations (e.g., Mercutio's death leading to Romeo's banishment, the potion plan in Friar's cell leading to misunderstanding, Mantua for false news).
6. Include contextual information as properties or separate nodes/relationships (e.g., 'Tybalt's motivation: hatred for Montagues').
7. Populate the graph database with nodes for all key characters (Tybalt, Mercutio, Romeo, Benvolio, Prince Escalus, Juliet).
8. Add 'Mercutio' as a node with a 'close_friend_of' relationship to 'Romeo Montague' and a 'kinsman_of' relationship to 'Prince Escalus'.
9. Add nodes for 'Romeo Montague' and 'Benvolio Montague'.
10. Add the nuanced familial relationship by marriage: `(Tybalt)-[KINSMAN_BY_MARRIAGE_TO]->(Romeo)` with an attribute `aware: false`.
